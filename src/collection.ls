### -- Helpers ---------------------------------------------------------

#### λ to-array
#
# Converts a Collection to an Array. Only exists to guard on
# sequence-like host objects in engines like JScript.
#
# :: Coll a -> Array a
to-array = (xs) -> [x for x in xs]


#### λ collection-p
#
# Checks if something is a Collection.
#
# :: a -> Bool
collection-p = (a) ->
  a && (not a.node-type) \
    && a.length >= 0




### -- Accessing elements ----------------------------------------------

#### λ head
#
# Returns the first item of a collection.
#
# :: Coll a -> Maybe a
head = (xs) -> (as-collection xs).0


#### λ tail
#
# Returns a new collection without the first item.
#
# :: Coll a -> Coll a
tail = (xs) -> [x for x, i in (as-collection xs) when i > 0]


#### λ last
#
# Returns the last item of a collection.
#
# :: Coll a -> Maybe a
last = (xs) -> (as-collection xs)[*-1]



### -- Conversions -----------------------------------------------------

#### λ as-collection
#
# Turns anything into a collection.
#
# :: a -> Coll a
# :: Coll a -> Coll a
as-collection = (x) ->
  | collection-p x => x
  | otherwise      => [x]



### -- Iterators and folds ---------------------------------------------

#### λ each
#
# Applies a function to each item in the Collection.
#
# :: (a -> IO ()) -> xs:Coll a* -> xs
each = (f, xs) -->
  ys = as-collection xs
  for x, i in ys => f x
  ys


#### λ map
#
# Transforms a Collection by applying the given function to each item.
#
# :: (a -> b) -> Coll a -> Coll b
map = (f, xs) --> [(f x) for x in (as-collection xs)]


#### λ reduce
#
# Computes a value by incrementally reducing a collection with a binary
# function.
#
# :: (b, a -> b) -> b -> Coll a -> b
reduce = (f, initial, xs) -->
  result = initial
  for x in (as-collection xs) => result = (f result, x)
  result


#### λ concat
#
# Concatenates several collections together.
#
# :: Coll a... -> Coll a
concat = (...xs) ->
  append = (ys, a) ->
    ys.push.apply ys, a
    ys

  reduce append, [], (as-collection xs)


#### λ map-concat
#
# Maps over a collection concatenating the resulting collections.
#
# :: (a -> [b]) -> Coll a -> [b]
map-concat = (f, xs) -->
  flat-transform = (ys, a) ->
    ys.push.apply ys, (f a)
    ys

  reduce flat-transform, [], (as-collection xs)
