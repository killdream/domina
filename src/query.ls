  ### -- Core implementation -------------------------------------------

  #### λ query
  #
  # Returns a set of nodes that match the given CSS selector.
  #
  # Optionally, this function can restrict the returned set of elements
  # to a given `context`, such that only nodes that are children of
  # such `context` will be returned.
  #
  # :: Selector, Element? -> Coll Element
  query = (selector, context = document) ->
    to-array (context.query-selector-all selector)


  #### λ matches-p
  #
  # Checks if an Element matches the given CSS selector.
  #
  # :: Selector -> Element -> Bool
  matches-p = (selector, node) -->
    internal-matches-p.call node, selector


  
  ### -- Exports ------------------------------------------------------
