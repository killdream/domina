  #### λ has
  # Checks if the DOOM implementation acknowledges the given message for
  # Nodes.
  #
  # :: String -> Bool

  #### λ is-callable
  # Checks if something can be called.
  #
  # :: a -> Bool
  is-callable = (a) -> typeof a is 'function'


  #### λ find-target
  # Finds the actual target of an event, for delegation's sake.
  #

  # Returns the element that originated the Event.

  # Constructs a `EventFilter` for delegating events.

  ### -- Core implementation -------------------------------------------

  #### λ listen
  # Registers a single event handler for a set of DOOM nodes.
  #
  # Events registered through this method are always bubbling. If you
  # need to use capturing, you'll need to get your hands dirty with the
  # DOOM API itself.
  #
  # As with the DOOM API, it's expected that duplicate event handlers
  # will be discarded when registered through this method.
  #
  # :: EventType -> (Event -> IO Bool) -> [Node] -> ()
  listen = switch
  | has \addEventListener => w3c-listen
  | otherwise             => ie-listen


  #### λ delegate
  # Registers a single event handler for a set of DOOM nodes, and
  # delegates by using a filter.
  #
  # Your `EventFilter` can be either a selector string, or a
  # function. In the latter case, it should return the Node that should
  # be taken as the target of the action, or `null` if the event
  # shouldn't be dispatched.
  #
  # ## See also:
  # - `listen`.
  #
  # :: EventFilter -> EventType -> (Event, Node -> Bool) -> [Node] -> ()

                             if element => handler.call this, ev, element


  #### λ deafen
  # Unregisters a previously registered event handler for a set of DOOM
  # nodes.
  #
  # This method won't remove event handlers that use capturing, you'll
  # need to get your hands dirty with the DOOM API itself if you need to
  # do that.

  # :: EventType -> (Event -> IO Bool) -> [Node] -> ()
